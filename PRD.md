## ðŸ“‹ Pull Request History

### PR #11: Online Status Accuracy Fix
**Status:** âœ… Merged to `main`  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~1 hour

**Problem Fixed:**
When emulators/apps were force-killed, the `onStop()` lifecycle callback never fired, leaving users with `isOnline = true` in Firestore indefinitely. This caused all users to appear online even when they weren't running the app.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added 60-second heartbeat mechanism to update `lastSeen` timestamp while app is in foreground
- Created `isActuallyOnline()` helper function that validates both `isOnline = true` AND `lastSeen` within 2 minutes
- Updated all 7 UI locations to use `isActuallyOnline()` instead of raw `isOnline` flag
- Changed registration to set `isOnline = false` (app lifecycle sets true on launch)

**Technical Details:**
- `GChatApplication.kt`: Added `heartbeatJob` coroutine with 60-second delay loop
- `User.kt`: Added `isActuallyOnline()` with 2-minute timestamp validation
- Updated: ConversationListScreen, ChatScreen, DMInfoScreen, GroupInfoScreen, NewConversationScreen
- `AuthRepositoryImpl.kt`: Set `isOnline = false` for new user registration (email & Google Sign-In)

**Behavior:**
- App running: Heartbeat keeps `lastSeen` fresh, user shows online
- Force-kill: After 2 minutes of no heartbeat, user auto-appears offline
- Proper close: `onStop()` sets `isOnline = false` immediately
- Reopen: `onStart()` sets `isOnline = true` and restarts heartbeat

**Bugs Fixed:**
- Fixed stale online status after force-kill
- Fixed new users defaulting to online before first app launch
- Fixed online indicators not updating within 2 minutes of inactivity

### PR #13: Inline Translation UI
**Status:** âœ… Merged to `main`  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~4 hours

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Long-press message to show translation menu
- âœ… Language selector dialog with 20+ supported languages
- âœ… Inline translation display below original message
- âœ… Translation loading indicator
- âœ… Error handling with retry button
- âœ… Hide translation button to dismiss
- âœ… Translation caching in Firestore (30-day TTL)
- âœ… Local Room database cache for offline access
- âœ… Rate limiting (100 translations/hour, 200 language detections/hour)
- âœ… Works for both sent and received messages

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Backend (Firebase Functions):**
  - `translateMessage` Cloud Function with OpenAI GPT-4
  - Automatic source language detection
  - SHA-256 cache key generation
  - Rate limiting with Firestore tracking
  - Environment-based configuration (model, TTL, rate limits)
  
- **Android App:**
  - `Translation` domain model with 20+ language support
  - `TranslationRepository` with dual caching (Firestore + Room)
  - Room database v9 migration for translation cache
  - `TranslateMessageUseCase` for clean architecture
  - UI components: `LanguageSelectorDialog`, `TranslationDisplay`, `TranslationLoading`, `TranslationError`
  - Long-press gesture detection in `MessageBubble`
  - ViewModel state management for translations, loading, and errors

**Database Changes:**
- Room v8 â†’ v9: Added `TranslationEntity` table
- Room v9 â†’ v10: Added `lastMessageType` and `lastMessageMediaUrl` to `ConversationEntity`
- Firestore: Added `translations` collection for caching
- Firestore: Added `rateLimits/{userId}/features/{featureName}` for rate tracking

**Firestore Rules:**
- `translations` collection: Read for authenticated users, write only via Cloud Functions
- `rateLimits` collection: Internal only (Cloud Functions)

**Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. **Image Messages Not Syncing**
   - Root cause: Firestore rules rejected `text = null` for image-only messages
   - Fix: Updated `isValidMessage()` to allow `text == null || text is string`
   
2. **Conversation Preview Showing "New Message"**
   - Root cause: Repository hardcoded `type=TEXT` and `mediaUrl=null` when reading from Room
   - Fix: Read `entity.lastMessageType` and `entity.lastMessageMediaUrl` in 4 locations
   
3. **Translation Loading Not Showing**
   - Root cause: UI wasn't collecting translation state flows from ViewModel
   - Fix: Added `collectAsState()` for `translations`, `translationLoading`, `translationErrors`

4. **Image-Only Message Sync Failure**
   - Root cause: `SendMessageUseCase` passed empty string `""` instead of `message.text` (null)
   - Fix: Pass `message.text` to ensure consistency between message and conversation preview

**Behavior:**
- User long-presses any text message â†’ Language selector appears
- Select target language â†’ Loading indicator shows â†’ Translation appears below message
- Translation cached locally and in Firestore for 30 days
- Second translation of same message loads instantly from cache
- Image messages do NOT show translation menu (long-press ignored)
- Rate limit exceeded â†’ Error message with friendly explanation
- Translation error â†’ Retry button to attempt again

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~1.5 hours

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Real-time typing indicators in 1-on-1 and group chats
- âœ… Animated typing dots with smooth fade animation
- âœ… Debouncing logic (typing stops after 3 seconds of inactivity)
- âœ… Smart formatting for group chats ("John is typing...", "John and Sarah are typing...", "John, Sarah, and 2 others are typing...")
- âœ… Automatic typing status cleanup on message send
- âœ… Efficient Firestore listeners with minimal writes

**UI Design:**
- Typing indicator appears at the bottom of the message list
- Translucent gray bubble with italic text
- Three animated dots that fade in and out sequentially
- Shows user names for clarity in group chats
- Does not show your own typing status (filters out current user)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `TypingIndicator` domain model (conversationId, userId, isTyping, timestamp)
- Created `FirestoreTypingDataSource` for real-time typing updates
- Created `TypingRepository` and `TypingRepositoryImpl` for typing operations
- Updated `ChatViewModel` to track and broadcast typing status
- Added debouncing with 3-second timeout using coroutine Job cancellation
- `updateMessageText()` sets typing status on text change
- `sendMessage()` clears typing status immediately
- Created `TypingIndicator`, `TypingDots`, and `TypingDot` composables
- Uses `rememberInfiniteTransition` for smooth animated dots
- Firestore rules already support typing subcollection (read/write by participants)

**How It Works:**
1. User types â†’ `updateMessageText()` called
2. Set `isTyping = true` in Firestore `/conversations/{id}/typing/{userId}`
3. Start 3-second debounce timer
4. If no typing activity â†’ auto-clear typing status
5. Other users observe typing indicators via Firestore snapshot listener
6. `typingIndicatorText` StateFlow formats names ("John is typing...")
7. UI displays typing indicator at bottom of chat with animated dots
8. On send message â†’ clear typing status immediately

**Bugs Fixed:**
- Fixed typing indicators not showing in 1-on-1 chats (populated participantUsers for all chats, not just groups)
- Fixed race condition where typing indicators wouldn't update if user data loaded after typing started (changed from `.map()` to `combine()` for reactive updates)

**Testing Notes:**
- Open chat on two devices
- Type on Device A â†’ Device B should see "[Name] is typing..." within 500ms
- Stop typing â†’ indicator should disappear after 3 seconds
- Send message â†’ indicator should disappear immediately
- Group chat: multiple users typing should show all names
- Typing indicator should auto-scroll to bottom

- **Group Chats:**
  - Small profile picture avatars of users who read the message
  - Stacked avatars (max 3 visible, "+X" for additional readers)
  - Positioned at bottom-right of message bubble next to timestamp
  - Sender's avatar excluded from read indicators

**Technical Implementation:**
- Updated `Message.readBy` from `List<String>` to `Map<String, Long>` (userId â†’ readTimestamp)
- Created `MarkMessageAsReadUseCase` for marking messages as read
- Added helper functions: `isReadBy()`, `getReadTimestamp()`, `isReadByAll()`, `isReadByAny()`
