## ðŸ“‹ Pull Request History

### PR #8: Typing Indicators
**Status:** ðŸš§ In Progress (feature/pr8-typing-indicators)  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~1 hour

**Features Implemented:**
- âœ… Real-time typing indicators in 1-on-1 and group chats
- âœ… Animated typing dots with smooth fade animation
- âœ… Debouncing logic (typing stops after 3 seconds of inactivity)
- âœ… Smart formatting for group chats ("John is typing...", "John and Sarah are typing...", "John, Sarah, and 2 others are typing...")
- âœ… Automatic typing status cleanup on message send
- âœ… Efficient Firestore listeners with minimal writes

**UI Design:**
- Typing indicator appears at the bottom of the message list
- Translucent gray bubble with italic text
- Three animated dots that fade in and out sequentially
- Shows user names for clarity in group chats
- Does not show your own typing status (filters out current user)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created `TypingIndicator` domain model (conversationId, userId, isTyping, timestamp)
- Created `FirestoreTypingDataSource` for real-time typing updates
- Created `TypingRepository` and `TypingRepositoryImpl` for typing operations
- Updated `ChatViewModel` to track and broadcast typing status
- Added debouncing with 3-second timeout using coroutine Job cancellation
- `updateMessageText()` sets typing status on text change
- `sendMessage()` clears typing status immediately
- Created `TypingIndicator`, `TypingDots`, and `TypingDot` composables
- Uses `rememberInfiniteTransition` for smooth animated dots
- Firestore rules already support typing subcollection (read/write by participants)

**How It Works:**
1. User types â†’ `updateMessageText()` called
2. Set `isTyping = true` in Firestore `/conversations/{id}/typing/{userId}`
3. Start 3-second debounce timer
4. If no typing activity â†’ auto-clear typing status
5. Other users observe typing indicators via Firestore snapshot listener
6. `typingIndicatorText` StateFlow formats names ("John is typing...")
7. UI displays typing indicator at bottom of chat with animated dots
8. On send message â†’ clear typing status immediately

**Bugs Fixed:**
- None (new feature)

**Testing Notes:**
- Open chat on two devices
- Type on Device A â†’ Device B should see "[Name] is typing..." within 500ms
- Stop typing â†’ indicator should disappear after 3 seconds
- Send message â†’ indicator should disappear immediately
- Group chat: multiple users typing should show all names
- Typing indicator should auto-scroll to bottom

### PR #6: Read Receipts
**Status:** âœ… Merged to `main`  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~1.5 hours

- âœ… Read receipts for group chats (profile picture avatars)
- âœ… Auto-mark messages as read when conversation is opened
- âœ… Real-time read status updates across devices
- âœ… Timestamp tracking for when each user reads a message

**UI Design:**
- **1-on-1 Chats:**
  - Single gray checkmark (âœ“) - Message sent but not read
  - Double white checkmarks (âœ“âœ“) - Message read by recipient
- **Group Chats:**
  - Small profile picture avatars of users who read the message
  - Stacked avatars (max 3 visible, "+X" for additional readers)
  - Positioned at bottom-right of message bubble next to timestamp
  - Sender's avatar excluded from read indicators

**Technical Implementation:**
- Updated `Message.readBy` from `List<String>` to `Map<String, Long>` (userId â†’ readTimestamp)
- Created `MarkMessageAsReadUseCase` for marking messages as read
- Added helper functions: `isReadBy()`, `getReadTimestamp()`, `isReadByAll()`, `isReadByAny()`
- Created `ReadReceiptCheckmarks` composable for 1-on-1 chats
- Created `ReadByAvatars` composable for group chats (stacked profile pictures)
- Updated `MessageBubble` to conditionally show checkmarks vs avatars based on chat type
- `ChatViewModel.markAllMessagesAsRead()` auto-marks messages when screen is viewed
- Firestore and Room database support for read status persistence
- Backward compatible with old list format

**Bugs Fixed:**
- Fixed compilation errors from `readBy` type change (List â†’ Map)
- Consolidated duplicate use case files (removed plural version)

**Testing Notes:**
- Send message from Device A, open chat on Device B to see read status change
- Group chats show stacked avatars of all users who have read the message
- Read status updates in real-time via Firestore listeners

**Cloud Functions Setup Required:**
1. Navigate to `firebase/functions/`
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

4. Verify functions are active in Firebase Console

**How It Works:**
1. User opens app â†’ FCM token retrieved and stored in Firestore
2. User sends message â†’ Firestore onCreate trigger
3. Cloud Function `sendMessageNotification` executes
4. Function fetches recipient FCM tokens from Firestore
5. Notification sent via Firebase Admin SDK
6. Recipient taps notification â†’ App opens to conversation

**Bugs Fixed:**
- None (new feature)

**Testing Notes:**
- Cloud Functions must be deployed for notifications to work
- Test with two devices: one sends message, other receives notification
- Foreground notifications appear as system notifications
- Background/killed app: notification wakes app on tap
